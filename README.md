# Romaji → 日本語 (PowerShell IME)

A small **PowerShell** GUI application that converts **romaji** (Latin alphabet used for Japanese) into **hiragana** or **katakana** in real time.  
Along with the `.ps1` script, this repository also provides a prebuilt **executable (.exe)** for easier usage without opening PowerShell.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Instant conversion from **romaji → hiragana**.
- Option to convert into **katakana**.
- Support for special combinations (kya, sho, cha, etc.).
- Simple, lightweight, and responsive **Windows Forms** interface.
- Buttons to **copy the output**, **clear input**, and **close** the application.
